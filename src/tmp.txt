acnt created by me in the firebase
key will be dist to a user
he can use the key as an acnt

firestore -> uid -> key
            timestamp -> timestamp
            value -> clipboard value

electron store to store the userkey

initially we search for key and see if its valid else we prompt to login i.e ask to enter the userkey

then its all good

Virtual CB:
    Props:
        top
        history
        id

How does VCB interact with system CB:
    app has 1 CB active in any point of time
    we check if CBTop and VCBTop are same if not then do appropriate actions

How does VCB interact with DB:
    if VCB has update it pushes to DB with {VCBId,value}
    if DB has any changes it updates corresponding VCB
    i.e 2 listeners


CheckCB:
    Every Second clipboard refresh
    check active VCBTop and text
    if diff update VCB,DB and refresh screen

changeIndex:
    listens to button for change of active index

Process:
    acticeIndex
    VCBList
    CheckCB()
    displayList()
    changeIndex()
    updateCB()
    updateDB()

    CB.getTop()
    CB.update(text)
    CB
    DB

Physical CB
VCBList
DB
change in DB -> change PCB,VCB
change in CB -> change CB,VCB

Top -> list of tops of each VCB
currTop = top of curr active VCB
